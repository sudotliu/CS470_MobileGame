				<h3>Game</h3>
				<p>	
					Aqueduct Adventures is the game designed by students in the CS 470 Game Development class at Cal Poly Pomona. 
					The class covers the development process for audio and visual design and production of games. 
					The design project involved students working in teams to develop a working game in ten weeks. These games will 
					be developed with respect to mobile devices on the iOS and Android platforms.
					The games primary theme involves Cal Poly's <a href = "http://aqueductfutures.wordpress.com/" target="other">Aqueduct Futures project</a>

				<h3>History</h3>
				<p>	
					The Los Angeles Aqueduct system comprising the Los Angeles Aqueduct (Owens Valley aqueduct) 
					and the Second Los Angeles Aqueduct, is a water conveyance system, built and operated by the 
					Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.[4] The Owens Valley aqueduct was designed and built 
					by the city's water department, at the time named the The Bureau of Los Angeles Aqueduct, under 
					the supervision of the department's Chief Engineer William Mulholland.[5] The system delivers water 
					from the Owens River in the Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains to Los Angeles, California.
				</p>
				<p>
					The project began in 1908 with a budget of US$24.5 million.[6][7][8] With 5,000 workers employed for its construction, 
					the Los Angeles Aqueduct was completed in 1913.The aqueduct consists of 223 mi (359 km) of 12-foot (3.7 m) diameter steel pipe,
					120 mi (190 km) of railroad track, two hydroelectric plants, 170 mi (270 km) of power lines, 240 mi (390 km) of telephone line,
					a cement plant, and 500 mi (800 km) of roads.[9] The aqueduct uses gravity alone to move water and also uses the water to generate
					electricity, so it is cost-efficient to operate.[10] The catastrophic failure of the St. Francis Dam in 1928 flooded parts of the
					present day Santa Clarita Valley and devastated much of the Santa Clara River Valley in Ventura County. Although not responsible 
					for the cause of the failure, it brought an end to Mulholland's career. Excluding incidents of sabotage by Owens Valley residents 
					in the early years,[11] the aqueduct system has been operated safely throughout its history and is still in operation.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					
					The construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct effectively eliminated the Owens Valley as a viable farming community, and devastated the
					Owens Lake ecosystem.[11] A group known as the "San Fernando Syndicate",[12] a group of investors who bought land in the 
					San Fernando Valley based on inside knowledge that the Los Angeles aqueduct would soon irrigate it, as well as Fred Eaton, Mulholland 
					and others connected with the project have long been criticized for using deceptive tactics and underhanded methods to obtain water rights
					and block the Bureau of Reclamation from building water infrastructure for the residents in Owens Valley.[13] By the 1920s, the aggressive 
					pursuits of the water rights and the diversion of the Owens River precipitated the outbreak of violence known as the California Water Wars.
					Farmers in Owens Valley attacked infrastructure, dynamiting the aqueduct numerous times and opening sluice gates to divert the flow of water.
				</p>
				<p>
					The aqueduct's water provided developers with the resources to quickly develop the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles through World War II.
					Mulholland's role in the vision and completion of the aqueduct and the growth of Los Angeles into a large metropolis is recognized and 
					well-documented. The William Mulholland Memorial Fountain, built in 1940 and located at Riverside Drive and Los Feliz Blvd. in Los Feliz is 
					dedicated to his memory and contributions. Mulholland Drive and Mulholland Dam are named for him as well.

			<h4>Concept</h4>			
			<p>
				<strong>Game Name:</strong></br>
				Aqueduct Adventures</br></br>

				<strong>Game Synopsis:</strong></br>

				An explorer travels the course of the LA Aqueduct, clearing various channels to allow water to flow to various parts of LA. 
				Each successful level unlocks a factoid about the history or persons involved in the construction of the aqueduct. 
				The game environment simulates both underground and aboveground infrastructure for the aqueduct. The overall aim of the game 
				is to get water flowing through all the channels in the aqueduct within reasonable time.</br></br>

				<strong>Short-term goal:</strong></br>
				create satisfactory aqueduct water flow for the current level of gameplay to progress in the storyline.</br></br>
                <strong>Long-term goal:</strong> successfully deliver water to all areas served by the LA Aqueduct while learning about its 
				extensive history.</br></br>

				<strong>Game Genre:</strong></br>
				Adventure / Educational / Puzzle / Strategy</br></br>

				<strong>Game Setting:</strong></br>

				This game will water-based. The water will be simulated using the Corona Box2D-based engine and numerous 
				water particles. We plan to use elements such as ramps, blocks, valves, pumps, pipes, and wells to manipulate the water 
				and simulate the LA Aqueduct. Each level will consist of some mixture of these elements and will provide a puzzle for the 
				player to solve in order to clear the way for the water. The game world as a whole will be seen from the main map, and each
				level will represent an above ground or under ground portion of the aqueduct. We will place the levels in geographically meaningful 
				places relevant to the LA Aqueduct system. Sound and visual effects may include anything to do with water flow.
				The levels will become progressively more difficult as the game progresses.</br></br>
